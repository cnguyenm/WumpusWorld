Welcome!

The wumpus world is a cave consisting of rooms connected by passageways. Lurking
somewhere in the cave is the terrible wumpus, a beast that eats anyone who enters its room.

The wumpus can be shot by an agent, but the agent has only one arrow. Some rooms contain
bottomless pits that will trap anyone who wanders into these rooms (except for the wumpus,
which is too big to fall in). The only mitigating feature of this bleak environment is the
possibility of finding a heap of gold.

This game main purpose is to illustrate the use of first-order logics in Artificial Intelligence
